# Issues We Solved - DeployHub

## 🚨 What We Encountered & Fixed

### 1. Backend Server Not Running
**What happened**: Got `Failed to load resource: net::ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED` when trying to deploy to `:3001/deploy-s3`

**Root cause**: Backend server wasn't started - the `src/backend/local-server.ts` exists but wasn't running

**What we did**:
- Found the backend code in `src/backend/`
- Compiled TypeScript with `npm run build` 
- Started server with `npm run start`
- Server now runs on port 3001

**Fix for future**:
```bash
npm run start:backend
# or
./start-backend.sh
```

### 2. Missing npm Scripts
**What happened**: Tried `npm run start` but got "Missing script: start"

**Root cause**: No "start" script in main package.json

**What we did**: Added proper scripts for backend management

**Fix for future**:
```bash
npm run start:backend    # Backend only
npm run start:fullstack  # Both frontend & backend
npm run dev              # Frontend only
```

### 3. QuillBot Browser Extension Errors
**What happened**: Multiple `Cannot read properties of null (reading 'editorId')` errors in console

**Root cause**: QuillBot browser extension, not our app

**What we did**: Identified it's external - can safely ignore

## 🚀 What We Built

- **Backend startup scripts**: `start-backend.sh`, `start-full-stack.sh`
- **npm scripts**: Added backend management commands
- **Troubleshooting docs**: `TROUBLESHOOTING.md` and this file

## 📍 Current Setup

- **Frontend**: http://localhost:8080 (Vite dev server)
- **Backend**: http://localhost:3001 (Express server)
- **Health check**: http://localhost:3001/health

## 🔧 Quick Commands

```bash
# Start backend (what we needed)
npm run start:backend

# Start everything (recommended)
npm run start:fullstack

# Check if backend is working
curl http://localhost:3001/health
```
